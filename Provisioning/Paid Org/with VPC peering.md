What is Data Residency?
Data residency for Apigee meets compliance and regulatory requirements by allowing you to specify the geographic locations (regions) where Apigee data is stored. Historically, Apigee allowed you to select the instance region and analytics region; however, Apigee also has global infrastructure, such as an API proxy bundle or other customer data. With data residency, selecting the control plane location ensures that all customer content is stored within the specified region.
